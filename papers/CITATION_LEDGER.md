# Shared citation and evidence ledger

Status: working ledger for the paper-completion track. Every manuscript claim must point to one or more rows and to a committed artifact where applicable.

## Claim rules

- A source supports the proposition stated, not a stronger adjacent proposition.
- A secondary source cannot support a confirmed legal or engine-bug claim when a primary source is required.
- Time-varying sources require an effective date in the artifact or the claim is marked unresolved.
- Engine agreement is not an independent legal oracle.

## Quality and extraction evidence

The cross-repository quality register is committed at
`papers/foi-programme-quality-evidence.json`. It pins the local heads and
records stable lanes, Python/spaCy canaries, dependency and type baselines,
SBOM/provenance boundaries, and the deferred V2 extraction re-extraction gate.
It is evidence of repository-local checks only; it does not assert Zenodo,
Hugging Face, upstream merge, or extraction-accuracy publication status.
