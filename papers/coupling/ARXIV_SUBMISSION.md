## Abstract (paste into arXiv when authorized)

Rules-as-Code (RaC) initiatives typically focus on rules-heavy domains (such as tax-benefit calculations) or process-heavy domains (such as public record lifecycle tracking) in isolation. However, actual administrative operations require coupling these two surfaces. This paper presents a pragmatic, contract-based approach to coupling statutory rules and administrative processes. We define a lightweight Policy Interchange Contract (PIC) schema that acts as a boundary between process state machines (like foi-o for official information requests) and isolated rules modules. We evaluate this approach across two distinct case studies: Official Information Act (OIA) clocks in New Zealand, and a multi-state SNAP eligibility study. Our results demonstrate that decoupled rules modules can achieve 100% differential testing parity while maintaining strict import-graph isolation and preserving non-computable discretion points.
