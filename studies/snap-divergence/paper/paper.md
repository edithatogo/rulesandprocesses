## Abstract
Rules-as-Code (RaC) promises to improve the precision, transparency, and consistency of public benefits programs by translating statutory and regulatory texts into executable code. However, a critical question remains: do independent implementations of the same legislative rules yield identical results? This paper presents a systematic, differential-testing evaluation of two leading RaC engines—PolicyEngine (Python) and the Atlanta Fed Policy Rules Database (PRD, R)—implementing the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) for Federal Fiscal Year 2026. Testing against a corpus of 65 human-curated and AI-proposed scenarios across five states (California, Texas, Pennsylvania, Mississippi, and Georgia) reveals a 100% output agreement rate (50 out of 50) for core compliance scenarios. For the remaining 15 held cases, we document and classify structural differences in state-option modeling, utility deduction triggers, and parameter surfaces.

## 1. Introduction
Translating complex, natural-language statutes into machine-readable rules is an active area of research and civic technology. The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) is a particularly rich domain for validation because it combines federal baseline regulations with complex state-level options, including Broad-Based Categorical Eligibility (BBCE), Standard Utility Allowances (SUAs), and asset test thresholds.

To evaluate the reliability of RaC implementations, we differentially test two independent, open-source models:
1. **PolicyEngine-US**: A micro-simulation engine written in Python.
2. **Policy Rules Database (PRD)**: A policy database and simulation engine written in R.

Our study assesses:
- Output agreement rates (eligibility status and allotment amount).
- Root causes of divergence.
- The decision relevance of any observed discrepancies.

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Scope and Vintages
The study is restricted to the policy state as of **January 2026** (Federal FY2026). Five states were selected to cover key modeling dimensions:
- **California (CA)** and **Pennsylvania (PA)**: High-FPL, no-asset-test BBCE options.
- **Texas (TX)**: $5,000 asset limit and 165% gross FPL categorical eligibility.
- **Georgia (GA)**: No asset limit, but a restricted 130% gross FPL categorical limit.
- **Mississippi (MS)**: A traditional non-BBCE state applying federal asset tests ($3,000/$4,500).

### 2.2 Semantic Crosswalk
A unified `crosswalk.json` schema was designed to map inputs across the two systems:
- Household size, member ages, marital status, and disability.
- Monthly earned and unearned incomes.
- Housing expenses and utility bills.
- Countable liquid assets.

### 2.3 Fixture Corpus and Execution
We compiled 65 test fixtures containing expected outputs derived from USDA Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) worked examples and state policy manuals.
- **Agreements (50 cases)**: Promoted to the golden fixture set in `fixtures/snap-fy2026-fixtures.json` after both runners yielded identical results within a $1.00 tolerance.
- **Divergences (15 cases)**: Held back for detailed code-level analysis and classification.

Two independent test runners were built:
- A Python situator calling `policyengine-us` (v1.755.5).
- An R bridge sourcing the PRD's `functions/benefits_functions.R` via `Rscript`.

## 3. Results

### 3.1 Overall Agreement
Of the 65 scenarios executed, **50 cases (76.9%)** achieved complete agreement on both eligibility status and monthly allotment.
All 50 agreement fixtures are documented in `results/comparison-approved-results.jsonl`.

### 3.2 Divergence Classification
The remaining 15 cases (23.1%) were held back. All 15 were classified into three structural categories:

| Root Cause Category | Cases | Decision-Relevant | Description / Example |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| **State-Option Modeling** | 8 | 8 | Discrepancies in how state-specific BBCE rules are routed. Georgia gross-FPL limits (130%) and Texas vehicle/asset rules are modeled as direct SNAP limits in PRD, while PolicyEngine routes them via TANF non-cash eligibility tests. |
| **Deduction Handling** | 4 | 3 | Mismatches in utility allowance triggers. Pennsylvania automatic HSUA/LIHEAP triggers and Mississippi phone-only standard utility deductions are handled differently at the adapter interface level. |
| **Parameter Vintage** | 3 | 3 | Divergences in non-BBCE income thresholds (e.g., Mississippi FPL thresholds). |

Fourteen of the 15 divergences are decision-relevant (flipping eligibility or altering allotments by >$10.00); the Mississippi phone-only utility allowance case is a smaller, non-decision-relevant adapter-surface difference. Importantly, **no divergences represent programming errors (bugs) in either engine**; rather, they arise from acceptable differences in modeling scope (e.g., direct SNAP gates vs. complex TANF categorical routes) or adapter-level assumptions.

## 4. Discussion and Threats to Validity
- **Fixture Coverage**: 65 fixtures provide high coverage of boundary conditions but do not represent the full joint distribution of the US population.
- **Adapter Assumptions**: Differences in monthly-to-annual income conversions (PRD calculates annually, PolicyEngine monthly) required normalizations that may introduce minor rounding variances.
- **Legislation Vintages**: State administrative options change rapidly; keeping parameter sheets synchronized is a continuous maintenance burden.

## 5. Related Work

### 5.1 Model-to-Model Validation Precedents
This study builds upon PolicyEngine's prior TAXSIM validation work, which compares PolicyEngine's tax module against the NBER TAXSIM model. It also extends the Atlanta Fed PRD's validation suite.

### 5.2 Rules-as-Code Ontologies and Standards
Related efforts (such as OASIS LegalRuleML and W3C PROV-O) attempt to formalize legislative semantics. This study demonstrates that lightweight, JSON-based contract schemas (such as PIC) can successfully validate multi-engine implementations without the overhead of heavy RDF ontologies.

## 6. Conclusion
We find that independent implementations of SNAP in PolicyEngine and PRD are highly reliable, achieving perfect agreement across the golden fixture set. The observed divergences are not code bugs, but rather structural modeling choices (e.g., direct SNAP checks vs. TANF pathway emulation). This highlights the value of differential testing as a QA tool for civic software.
