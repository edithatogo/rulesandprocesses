# FOI-O v0.8.1 release-evidence handoff

Status (rechecked 2026-07-17): candidate remediation approved by Dylan as the basis for upstream
review. This file is not an upstream release, evidence bundle, or publication
claim.

FOI-O issue #27 remains open. No complete release-evidence bundle was observed
in the issue state reviewed on 2026-07-17. Do not convert the published tag,
DOIs, author comments, or detached candidate into empirical, migration,
consumer-contract, or independent-validation evidence.

## Verified release input

- Repository: <https://github.com/edithatogo/foi-o>
- Tag: `v0.8.1`
- Commit: `d24ae6f9f2d9488052969f633d91eff4a9a47f58`
- Zenodo version DOI: `10.5281/zenodo.21360138`
- Zenodo concept DOI: `10.5281/zenodo.21360137`
- Evidence-bundle gate: <https://github.com/edithatogo/foi-o/issues/27>

## Immutable-tag validation

The tag was checked in a clean detached worktree with:

```text
uv sync --extra dev --extra rdf
uv run pytest -q
```

Before remediation, the result was `278 passed, 2 skipped, 2 failed`. The
failures were stale inventory values in the coverage matrix and generated
maturation summary, not an unverified empirical result.

## Candidate remediation

Detached candidate commit `995dbd27530bbe2ab97bd10d0e6c2812baf00758` updates:

- `docs/24-schema-ontology-coverage-matrix.md`: documentation count `52` and
  Python test-module count `53`;
- `examples/maturation-summary.ontology-maturation.json`: regenerated from the
  tagged repository tree.

The candidate was then rechecked with the same environment and produced
`280 passed, 2 skipped`. It has not been pushed to `foi-o` and does not replace
the upstream tag.

## Approval boundary

On 2026-07-15 Dylan approved `995dbd2` as the remediation basis for a corrected
immutable FOI-O release. The approval authorizes upstream review and application
of that candidate; it does not approve the candidate for direct promotion,
replace the `v0.8.1` tag, or certify the evidence bundle.

## Still required for #27

The upstream release-evidence bundle must still include and substantiate the
release tag/SHA, contract versions, capabilities, migrations, tests, fixtures,
provenance, empirical results, exceptions, and limitations. The FOI-O plan
still marks extraction-contract, consumer-contract, independent fixture,
source-triangulation, empirical adjudication, and evidence-bundle tasks as
open. This handoff does not certify any of those unfinished gates.

## Human boundary

Upstream FOI-O work remains required to apply and review the candidate, publish
a corrected immutable release, and generate the accepted evidence bundle. No
upstream branch, PR, release, dataset, or paper action is performed by this
handoff.
