# Maintainer response monitoring

Last checked: **2026-07-17** (live PR sweep: RuleSpec NZ #79/#80 closed after the maintainer confirmed the fix was reproduced on upstream `main`; PolicyEngine #515-#517, OpenFisca #1382, and OpenFisca Aotearoa #200 remain externally blocked; Alaveteli remains closed without merge).

Bot / author-only comments do **not** count as maintainer replies.

## Hard external blockers (cannot clear from this agent)

1. **First-time fork workflow approval** on PolicyEngine PRs #515–#517 (empty check rollup until a maintainer approves Actions).

2. **Maintainer review and hosted CI** remain unresolved for OpenFisca #1382
   (`REVIEW_REQUIRED`) and OpenFisca Aotearoa #200 (`REVIEW_REQUIRED`); neither
   has a contributor-controlled action that can produce an upstream outcome.

RuleSpec NZ #80 is no longer a blocker: the shared-secret signing path was
superseded by the supervised-encoder migration, and the maintainer confirmed
the fix on upstream `main` before closing the PR with credit.
