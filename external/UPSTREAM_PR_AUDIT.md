# Upstream pull request quality audit

Last verified: 2026-07-11.

## Audit standard

Every contribution must have a corresponding issue, focused problem statement, explicit scope and non-goals, reproducible verification, compatibility/risk notes, a concrete reviewer ask, and honest CI status. Issue and PR URLs must both appear in GitHub Project 19. External review, workflow approval, signing, and merge remain maintainer gates.

## Boundaries

- Empty check rollups are not passes.
- Local test evidence does not replace upstream CI.
- No maintainer approval, signing credential, or merge is inferred from contributor evidence.
- Project status `In Progress` means submitted and unresolved, not accepted upstream.
