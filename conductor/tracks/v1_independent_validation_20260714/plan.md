# Implementation Plan

GitHub issue: [#45](https://github.com/edithatogo/rac-conformance/issues/45). Depends on release-candidate artifacts from [#41](https://github.com/edithatogo/rac-conformance/issues/41)-[#44](https://github.com/edithatogo/rac-conformance/issues/44) and complements existing adoption issue [#23](https://github.com/edithatogo/rac-conformance/issues/23).

## Phase 1 - Independence Contract and Implementer Kit

- [x] Task: Define independent-validation evidence policy
    - [x] Define organisational, repository, codebase, oracle, fixture-curation, and execution independence.
    - [x] Define qualifying, partial, conflicting, withdrawn, declined, and unresponsive outcomes.
    - [x] Define freshness and maintenance requirements.
    - **Acceptance:** self-owned forks, agent-generated fixtures, and unacknowledged issues cannot satisfy the gate.
    - **Evidence:** `docs/INDEPENDENT_VALIDATION_POLICY.md`, `INDEPENDENCE_CRITERIA.json`, and `tools/tests/test_independence_policy.py` define eight independence dimensions, six outcomes, freshness windows, and explicit non-qualifying statuses.
- [x] Task: Build self-contained implementer kit
    - [x] Package a versioned schema, examples, negative corpus, expected-result policy, runner instructions, and result manifest.
    - [x] Remove assumptions about local paths, private services, or unpublished source material.
    - [x] Add a clean-environment rehearsal runner.
    - **Acceptance:** an uninvolved reviewer can reproduce the kit's reference run.
    - **Evidence:** `independent/kit/` is the sole self-contained kit for `pic-semantics/0.1.0`; `run_reference.py` imports only `jsonschema`, verifies manifest-pinned artifact digests, computes a kit digest, and labels its output `reference-runner-only`.
    > REMEDIATION CHECKPOINT (2026-07-18): Consolidated the divergent public
    > and track-local kits into `independent/kit/`. The canonical kit now
    > bundles the current contract byte-for-byte, pins every artifact digest,
    > verifies those digests before execution, and is protected by uniqueness,
    > source-drift, and clean-environment regression tests.
- [x] Task: Build conformance evidence verifier
    - [x] Validate implementation identity, versions, environment, artifact digests, result signatures/checksums, and test outcomes.
    - [x] Reject stale, incomplete, self-certified, or unverifiable submissions.
    - **Acceptance:** verifier emits deterministic evidence status and precise exceptions.
    - **Evidence:** `SUBMISSION_SCHEMA.json`, `tools/independent_evidence.py`, and `tools/tests/test_independent_evidence.py` provide a network-free artifact-backed packet contract, deterministic classification, and fail-closed coverage for qualifying, partial, conflicting, withdrawn, declined, unresponsive, rejected, stale, tampered, incomplete, and internally controlled cases.
    > REMEDIATION CHECKPOINT (2026-07-18): Replaced self-declared v1 evidence
    > qualification with the v2 artifact-backed contract. Qualification now
    > requires all eight independence dimensions, exact canonical-kit and
    > evidence digests, complete unique passing corpus results, distinct local
    > acknowledgement and attestation artifacts, explicit limitations and
    > mismatches, and the policy-defined 90-day release-candidate window. The
    > legacy verifier delegates to this fail-closed path.
- [x] Task: Conductor - Automated Review and Checkpoint 'Phase 1 - Independence Contract and Implementer Kit' (Protocol in workflow.md)
    - **CHECKPOINT:** Policy, self-contained kit, deterministic verifier, and clean-room agent rehearsal are complete. Local tests and the clean evaluator run pass; semantic integrity, external implementation, external acknowledgement, and v1 adoption remain deferred to later phases.
    > AUTOMATED REVIEW (2026-07-19): Three independent review lanes found and
    > remediated contract-version, kit-integrity, path-boundary, result-binding,
    > attestation-trust, status-transition, and documentation defects. The
    > canonical kit now hashes all normative and executable files and executes
    > only manifested cases. External attestation requires an analyst-trusted
    > digest; the trust registry remains empty, so no qualification is claimed.

## Phase 2 - Candidate Engagement

- [x] Task: Identify candidate consumers and bounded integration surfaces
    - [x] Prioritise maintainers already facing fixture, trace, process, or conformance pain.
    - [x] Respect the one-unresolved-proposal-per-upstream rule.
    - [x] Record target problem, expected effort, owner, source repository, and no-response exit condition.
    - **Acceptance:** each candidate has a real consumer problem rather than a generic standards pitch.
    - **Evidence:** `external/independent-validation/CANDIDATE_REGISTRY.json` records three concrete upstream problem surfaces plus a preferred unaffiliated implementer route, with ownership, effort, independence risks, and no-response exits. No candidate is treated as adoption.
- [x] Task: Prepare implementation and feedback packets
    - [x] Draft upstream-native issue/PR or workshop material under `external/<repo>/`.
    - [x] Include scope, reproduction, minimal artifact, maintenance burden, and exit path.
    - [x] Do not submit without authorization.
    - **Acceptance:** packets are reviewable and do not overstate current adoption.
    - **Evidence:** draft packets are staged under `external/policyengine/`, `external/openfisca/`, `external/independent-validation/openfisca-aotearoa/`, and `external/independent-validation/UNAFFILIATED_IMPLEMENTER_INVITATION.md`; each names a bounded problem, reproduction contract, maintenance burden, exit path, and human submission boundary.

> CHECKPOINT (2026-07-17): Candidate selection and packet preparation are
> complete. The registry documents concrete consumer pain, ownership, effort,
> independence risks, and no-response exits. Four bounded packets are staged
> under `external/`; authorized OpenFisca and PolicyEngine requests are now
> recorded, while no local rehearsal is counted as adoption.
- [x] Task: [HUMAN] Approve external outreach and submissions
    - [x] Dylan selects targets and authorizes each communication or submission.
    - **Packet:** `OUTREACH_AUTHORIZATION_PACKET.md` provides per-target choices, scope, response limits, and the no-adoption-without-verification boundary.
    - [x] Record submitted URL or deferred/declined disposition.
    - **Acceptance:** every external action has explicit authorization and durable evidence.
    > OUTREACH RECORDED (2026-07-17): Dylan authorized one bounded OpenFisca
    > core request. The comment is recorded at
    > https://github.com/openfisca/openfisca-core/issues/1380#issuecomment-4998515274
    > with a 14-day response window and one-follow-up limit. The target remains
    > pending maintainer response; no adoption or independent result is claimed.
    > OUTREACH UPDATE (2026-07-17): Dylan authorized one bounded PolicyEngine
    > request. The comment is recorded at
    > https://github.com/PolicyEngine/policyengine-core/issues/512#issuecomment-4998530912
    > with a 14-day response window and one-follow-up limit. The target remains
    > pending maintainer response; no adoption or independent result is claimed.
    > HUMAN DECISION (2026-07-17): Dylan approved deferring the unaffiliated
    > research/public-sector route until a named organisation, repository,
    > owner, and communication channel are identified. No generic invitation
    > will be sent and no internal rehearsal will satisfy the v1 gate.
- [x] Task: Conductor - Automated Review and Checkpoint 'Phase 2 - Candidate Engagement' (Protocol in workflow.md)
    - **REVIEW:** Authorized bounded requests are recorded; maintainer responses and qualifying evidence remain external dependencies.

> STATUS RECHECK (2026-07-17): Local analyst review and upstream-status
> packets are staged under `external/independent-validation/`. Authorized
> bounded outreach was submitted to PolicyEngine and OpenFisca core and is
> awaiting maintainer response within the recorded 14-day windows. No
> independent result, qualifying consumer, or FOI-O evidence bundle was added;
> the gate remains blocked. Additional targets remain subject to separate
> human authorization.

## Phase 3 - Result Verification and Feedback

- [ ] Task: Verify independent results
    - [ ] Reproduce qualifying submissions from pinned artifacts.
    - [ ] Classify mismatches as contract, implementation, source/fixture, environment, or unresolved.
    - [ ] Preserve external authorship and evidence provenance.
    - **Acceptance:** no external result is accepted solely from a screenshot or narrative claim.
- [ ] Task: Resolve contributor-controlled contract defects
    - [ ] Add failing regression tests before fixes.
    - [ ] Apply normal compatibility and migration rules.
    - [ ] Notify known consumers and rerun compatibility matrices.
    - **Acceptance:** fixes do not special-case an implementer or weaken prior consumers silently.
- [ ] Task: Update public adoption and release-gate ledgers
    - [ ] Link qualifying, partial, declined, unresponsive, and blocked outcomes.
    - [ ] Keep Project 19 and the machine-readable gate manifest synchronized.
    - **Acceptance:** public status is no stronger than external evidence.
    > CONTRIBUTOR CHECKPOINT (2026-07-18): The candidate registry and dated
    > status snapshot now deterministically generate
    > `independent/STATUS_LEDGER.json`; CI rejects candidate, date, governing
    > issue, gate-status, or qualifying-consumer drift. The release gate now
    > points to issue #45 and the v2 evidence contract. This task remains open
    > for future external outcomes and Project 19 reconciliation, which is not
    > covered without a pinned project snapshot; no qualifying adoption is
    > claimed.
- [ ] Task: Conductor - Automated Review and Checkpoint 'Phase 3 - Result Verification and Feedback' (Protocol in workflow.md)

## Phase 4 - v1 Independence Certification

- [ ] Task: Generate independent-validation packet
    - [ ] Summarize consumers, domain classes, ownership, versions, results, defects, maintenance signals, and unresolved risks.
    - [ ] Demonstrate that fixture and implementation independence criteria hold.
    - **Acceptance:** each release claim links to a reproducible evidence chain.
- [ ] Task: [HUMAN] Certify v1 independent-adoption gate
    - [ ] Dylan approves pass, fail, or defer based on the published criteria.
    - [ ] A failed or incomplete gate blocks v1 but not continued 0.x releases.
    - **Acceptance:** gate status and reasons are recorded explicitly.
