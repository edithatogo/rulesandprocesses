# Plan: oia_rules_20260704 — OIA rules extraction for foi-o

Depends on: contracts_20260704 phases 1–3. Work is staged under `external/foi-o/`; upstream submission is `[HUMAN]`.

## Phase 1 — Statute verification and design

- [x] Task: Verify statutory text
    - [x] Fetch current consolidated OIA 1982 text (legislation.govt.nz) for ss 2 (working day definition), 14, 15, 15A, 28; record consolidation date
    - [x] Write `external/foi-o/rules/SOURCES.md`: quoted definitions, section refs, consolidation date, and any ambiguity notes (e.g. exact holiday exclusions in the s 2 working-day definition)
    - [x] If network unavailable: mark BLOCKED, proceed using placeholders clearly tagged `UNVERIFIED`, and add verification to the `[HUMAN]` review task
    - **Acceptance:** SOURCES.md exists; every rule in spec has a verified (or explicitly UNVERIFIED) citation
- [x] Task: Read foi-o conventions
    - [x] Read foi-o repo: `schemas/json/`, working-day/clock code paths, Pydantic models, test layout, `pyproject` extras
    - [x] Write `external/foi-o/rules/DESIGN.md`: where the module sits in foi-o's tree, how it aligns with the Mojo-first/Python-fallback contract, naming conventions to follow
    - **Acceptance:** DESIGN.md names exact foi-o paths/modules it integrates with
- [ ] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Phase 1' (Protocol in workflow.md)

## Phase 2 — Parameters and fixtures

- [ ] Task: Author PIC parameters
    - [ ] `working_day_limit` (20), `transfer_limit` (10), `holiday_exclusions` (calendar definition parameter), each with sourceRefs from SOURCES.md, one effective period from current consolidation
    - [ ] Validate with `pic-validate`
    - **Acceptance:** validation exits 0
- [ ] Task: Draft candidate fixtures (agent) 
    - [ ] ≥12 candidate cases into `rules/fixtures/candidates/`: the four mandatory scenarios from spec D1 plus holiday-boundary, year-boundary, transfer-chain, extension-grounds cases; every case carries `method: ai-proposed` and full provenance stubs
    - [ ] Validate with `pic-validate`
    - **Acceptance:** validation exits 0; mandatory scenarios present
- [ ] Task: [HUMAN] Fixture curation
    - [ ] Dylan reviews candidates against statute/Ombudsman guidance, promotes to `rules/fixtures/`, flips `method`, sets `interpreterOfRecord`
- [ ] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Phase 2' (Protocol in workflow.md)

## Phase 3 — Rules module (TDD)

- [ ] Task: Implement working-day calendar
    - [ ] Tests first from fixtures: `nz_working_days(start, n, calendar)` handles weekends, listed holidays, Dec–Jan exclusion, regional anniversary decision (document: OIA s 2 — check whether regional anniversaries are included; record in SOURCES.md)
    - [ ] Implement pure function; property test: adding then subtracting n working days round-trips
    - **Acceptance:** pytest green incl. property test
- [ ] Task: Implement decisions
    - [ ] Tests first for `response_deadline`, `transfer_deadline`, `extension_valid`, `deemed_refusal` incl. valueState propagation (`not_provided` receipt date → `unknown` deadline with warning, not an exception)
    - [ ] Implement; each returns `(outputs, trace_step)` per spec D2 shapes
    - [ ] Implement `urgency_flag` as `DiscretionPoint` producer; test asserts no computed outcome and non-certifiability
    - **Acceptance:** ≥90% branch coverage on module; all fixtures pass
- [ ] Task: Implement typed invocation interface
    - [ ] Tests first: invocation routes to correct decision; rule module import graph contains no foi-o process imports (assert via import inspection)
    - [ ] Implement `RuleInvocation`/`RuleResult`/`DiscretionPoint` dataclasses + dispatcher
    - **Acceptance:** pytest green; import-isolation test green
- [ ] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Phase 3' (Protocol in workflow.md)

## Phase 4 — Conformance and differential check

- [ ] Task: Fixture runner + trace emission
    - [ ] Runner executes all promoted fixtures, writes traces to `rules/traces/`, validates them with `pic-validate`, compares outputs with `trace_equivalence`
    - **Acceptance:** all fixtures pass; traces validate
- [ ] Task: Differential test vs existing foi-o kernels
    - [ ] Run the same fixtures through foi-o's existing working-day/clock implementation (vendored call or subprocess); diff results
    - [ ] Any disagreement: write it up in `rules/DIVERGENCE.md` (this is a *finding*, do not silently fix either side) and mark `[HUMAN]` adjudication
    - **Acceptance:** agreement, or documented divergence with adjudication task created
- [ ] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Phase 4' (Protocol in workflow.md)

## Phase 5 — Submission package

- [ ] Task: Write `external/foi-o/SUBMISSION.md`
    - [ ] Draft PR title/body per spec D4; file map; CI integration notes (pytest module foi-o can adopt); PIC reference as footnote
    - **Acceptance:** SUBMISSION.md complete and self-contained
- [ ] Task: [HUMAN] Submit upstream
    - [ ] Dylan opens the PR on edithatogo/foi-o (his own repo — low ceremony, but keep the PR shape so the pattern is reusable for third-party repos)
- [ ] Task: Update `contracts/CONSUMERS.md` — foi-o becomes first *actual* consumer
- [ ] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Phase 5' (Protocol in workflow.md)
