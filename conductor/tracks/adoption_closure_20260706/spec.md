# Adoption Closure And External Proof

## Overview

The first roadmap produced evidence and staged submissions. This track turns those staged artifacts into external proof where possible: live issues, PRs, CI links, responses, merge status, or explicit external blockers.

## Functional Requirements

1. Inventory every staged external artifact:
   - `external/foi-o/SUBMISSION.md`
   - `external/policyengine/SUBMISSION.md`
   - `external/policyengine/SUBMISSION_trace.md`
   - `external/policyengine/SUBMISSION_missingness.md`
   - `external/openfisca/SUBMISSION.md`
   - `external/openfisca/SUBMISSION_missingness.md`
   - `external/alaveteli/SUBMISSION.md`
   - `external/dbn/EMAIL.md` and `external/dbn/LOG.md`
2. Create `external/ADOPTION_STATUS.md` with one row per external target.
3. For each target, record:
   - artifact path;
   - intended upstream location;
   - current state: staged, sent, opened, submitted, under review, merged, declined, blocked;
   - CI/Actions status where applicable;
   - exact URL for issue/PR/email response if available;
   - next required actor.
4. Prepare patch branches or PR-ready bundles for targets where the current agent has access.
5. Monitor GitHub Actions/CI after any branch/PR creation and apply review/CI fixes within the authorized repository.
6. Record external gates honestly. If merge authority or maintainer response is missing, mark it blocked with the exact requirement instead of calling it complete.
7. Keep GitHub issue/project status synchronized with local adoption state.
8. Use native GitHub sub-issues under the roadmap parent issue where available.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- External repo work must respect each target repository's own contribution style.
- Do not force PIC branding into upstream contributions; lead with the maintainer's problem.
- Do not claim merge, publication, or acceptance without a URL or repo-local log evidence.
- Use one commit per task in this repository; external repositories get their own commits/branches only when explicitly touched.
- Use `conductor/github-planning.md` for labels, milestone, project, and sub-issue expectations.

## Acceptance Criteria

- `external/ADOPTION_STATUS.md` exists and is current.
- All staged submissions are either live externally, explicitly superseded, or marked with a concrete blocker.
- Any created PRs have passing required GitHub Actions, or a failing-check diagnosis with fixes applied where permitted.
- Merged PRs are recorded with URLs. Unmerged PRs list the remaining reviewer/maintainer action.
- GitHub issue/project rows reflect the same state as `external/ADOPTION_STATUS.md`.
- `make check` passes in this repo before the phase is checkpointed.

## Out Of Scope

- Rewriting the underlying PIC contracts.
- Creating new demos.
- Merging PRs in repositories where the agent lacks authority.
- Sending emails or posting issues without Dylan's approval when the target is marked `[HUMAN]`.
